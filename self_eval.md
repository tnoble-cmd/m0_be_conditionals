# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

    It is useful to use a `conditional` statement to come to check if something is absolutely true or if something is partially true. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    I would not do anything differently. I believe I have done everything in the prompts to the best of my ability.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    I think finding the solution to the "FizzBuzz" code challange brought me the most satisfaction. It embodies a majority of the lessons in this assignment as a whole. I also had to do a bit of research with the modulo operator and the "test case" to test my method. It was quite thought provoking.
